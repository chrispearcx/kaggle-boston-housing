# Boston Housing

## Predicting Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston

## Background
In this project, I will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. 

The **medv** variable is the target variable.

## Data description

The Boston data frame has 506 rows and 14 columns.

This data frame contains the following columns:

***crim:*** per capita crime rate by town.

***zn:*** proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

***indus:*** proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

***chas:*** Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).

***rm:*** average number of rooms per dwelling.

***age:*** proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.

***dis:*** weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.

***rad:*** index of accessibility to radial highways.

***tax:*** full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.

***ptratio:*** pupil-teacher ratio by town.

***black:*** 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.

***lstat:*** lower status of the population (percent).

***medv:*** median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.
